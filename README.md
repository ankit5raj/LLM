Key Features:
- LangChain Chains: Examples of conditional, parallel, and sequential chains for modular prompt execution.
- RAG Implementation: Retrieval-Augmented Generation using LangChain to enhance responses with custom knowledge bases.
- Tool Calling: Demonstrates how to call external tools/functions from within LLM chains.

Notebooks Included:
- rag_using_langchain.ipynb – Implements RAG for better context-aware LLM responses.
- tool_calling_in_langchain.ipynb – Showcases integrating external tools with LangChain pipelines.
